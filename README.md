Internship
This project uses simple linear regression to predict students' exam marks based on the number of hours they study. It demonstrates data visualization, model training, and evaluation techniques in a step-by-step manner. The dataset includes Hours of Study as the feature and Marks as the target variable. The regression model is implemented to fit a line, make predictions, and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and 
R2 score.
